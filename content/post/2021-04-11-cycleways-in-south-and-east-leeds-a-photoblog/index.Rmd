Taking advantage of a sunny Sunday me and a friend decided to check-out the latest active travel infrastructure developments in South and East Leeds.
We planned the route around two destinations and one well-established route: 

- The [Leeds Climate Innovation District](https://citu.co.uk/citu-places), a new sustainability-focussed housing development with 500+ new dwellings being built near central Leeds
- test

the well-known [Wyke Beck Way](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Wyke%20Beck%20Way%20Cycle%20Route.pdf).
