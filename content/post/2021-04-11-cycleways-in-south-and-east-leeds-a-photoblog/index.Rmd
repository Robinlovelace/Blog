Taking advantage of a sunny Sunday, a friend and I decided to check-out the latest active travel infrastructure developments in South and East Leeds.
We planned the route around two destinations and one well-established route: 

- The [Leeds Climate Innovation District](https://citu.co.uk/citu-places), a new sustainability-focussed housing development being built near central Leeds
- [Temple Newsam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Newsam), a publicly accessible stately home and leisure grounds part-designed by prolific landscaper [Capability Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Brown) in the 1760s and now owned by [Leeds City Council](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/)
- The well-known [Wyke Beck Way](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Wyke%20Beck%20Way%20Cycle%20Route.pdf), which runs North from Temple Newsam to Roundhay Park

An overview of the route is shown below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
s = c(
    # `Grey basemap` = "CartoDB.Positron",
    # `Coloured basemap` = "Esri.WorldTopoMap",
    `OSM existing cycle provision (CyclOSM)` = "https://tile.thunderforest.com/cycle/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?apikey=feae177da543411c9efa64160305212d",
    # `PCT commuting, Government Target` = "https://npttile.vs.mythic-beasts.com/commute/v2/govtarget/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
    # `PCT schools, Government Target` = "https://npttile.vs.mythic-beasts.com/school/v2/govtarget/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
    `Satellite image` = "https://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}'"
)
m = tm_shape(route) + tm_lines(lwd = 3) + tm_basemap(server = s) +
  tm_scale_bar() +
  tm_minimap(server = "Esri.WorldTopoMap")
tmap_save(m, "map-leeds-routes.html")

## Leeds Climate Innovation District

Leeds Climate Innovation District (LCID) is a major development in Leeds, with 500+ dwellings either in the process of being built or already being lived in (at the time of writing in April 2021).
I cannot comment on the energy efficiency ratings of the buildings (although I have little doubt that they are well insulated) but in terms of its appearance and accessibility by walking and cycling it is ground-breaking.
It is located on the East of the River Aire and to the West of the A61, a major road that wouldn't seem to provide a basis for sustainable and healthy living, as shown below.

I had heard of LCID and passed by it during early stages of construction but only appreciated its scale and level and ambition today after seeing the site.
In the spring sunshine it was stunning, as shown in the photo below.

My more immediate interest in the project was due to work.
The LCID is one of the case study sites we used to highlight the potential for the planning system to support active travel in the [ActDev project](https://actdev.cyipt.bike/).
As can be seen at [actdev.cyipt.bike/lcid/](https://actdev.cyipt.bike/lcid/routenetwork,buildings/#12/53.78895/-1.52639), the site performs well from a sustainable transport perspective, as shown below.

```{r}
knitr::include_url("https://actdev.cyipt.bike/lcid/routenetwork,buildings/#12/53.78895/-1.52639")
```

The reasons why the site scores so high from a sustainable perspective perspective are simple:

- A high proportion of trips in the surrounding area are made by public transport
- Many key destinations are within walking and cycling distance

The data driven approach can hide important details on the ground that can help or hinder active travel.
I was happy to see that the site had good accessibility to the key walking and cycling route to the West of the river, as shown in the photos below.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97888609@N02/51109825878/in/photostream/" title="IMG_20210411_120628"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51109825878_71fb66ff80_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="IMG_20210411_120628"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The walking and cycling provision on the LCID side of the river is good, with steps that are wide and a ramp for cycling, wheelchairs and pushchairs.
The ramp onto the bridge from the East side of the river has a shallow incline, although is unnecessarily maze-like (possibly this is to reduce cycling speeds to the benefit of other users which seems sensible given the wide range of people using the path).
