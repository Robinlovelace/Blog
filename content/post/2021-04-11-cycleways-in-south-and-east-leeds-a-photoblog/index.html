<p>Taking advantage of a sunny Sunday, a friend and I decided to check-out the latest active travel infrastructure developments in South and East Leeds.
We planned the route around two destinations and one well-established route:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://citu.co.uk/citu-places">Leeds Climate Innovation District</a>, a new sustainability-focussed housing development being built near central Leeds</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Newsam">Temple Newsam</a>, a publicly accessible stately home and leisure grounds part-designed by prolific landscaper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Brown">Capability Brown</a> in the 1760s and now owned by <a href="https://www.leeds.gov.uk/">Leeds City Council</a></li>
<li>The well-known <a href="https://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Wyke%20Beck%20Way%20Cycle%20Route.pdf">Wyke Beck Way</a>, which runs North from Temple Newsam to Roundhay Park</li>
</ul>
<p>An overview of the route is shown below:</p>

<h2>Leeds Climate Innovation District</h2>
<p>Leeds Climate Innovation District (LCID) is a major development in Leeds, with 500+ dwellings either in the process of being built or already being lived in (at the time of writing in April 2021).
I cannot comment on the energy efficiency ratings of the buildings (although I have little doubt that they are well insulated) but in terms of its appearance and accessibility by walking and cycling it is ground-breaking.
It is located on the East of the River Aire and to the West of the A61, a major road that wouldnâ€™t seem to provide a basis for sustainable and healthy living, as shown below.</p>

<p>I had heard of LCID and passed by it during early stages of construction but only appreciated its scale and level and ambition today after seeing the site.
In the spring sunshine it was stunning, as shown in the photo below.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97888609@N02/51109825653/in/photostream/" title="IMG_20210411_115742"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51109825653_2c6c205f2a_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="IMG_20210411_115742"></a>

<p>My more immediate interest in the project was due to work.
The LCID is one of the case study sites we used to highlight the potential for the planning system to support active travel in the <a href="https://actdev.cyipt.bike/">ActDev project</a>.
As can be seen at <a href="https://actdev.cyipt.bike/lcid/routenetwork,buildings/#12/53.78895/-1.52639">actdev.cyipt.bike/lcid/</a>, the site performs well from a sustainable transport perspective, as shown below.</p>
<iframe src="https://actdev.cyipt.bike/lcid/routenetwork,buildings/#12/53.78895/-1.52639" width="672" height="400px">
</iframe>
<p>The reasons why the site scores so high from a sustainable perspective perspective are simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>A high proportion of trips in the surrounding area are made by public transport</li>
<li>Many key destinations are within walking and cycling distance</li>
</ul>
<p>The data driven approach can hide important details on the ground that can help or hinder active travel.
I was happy to see that the site had good accessibility to the key walking and cycling route to the West of the river, as shown in the photos below.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/97888609@N02/51109825878/in/photostream/" title="IMG_20210411_120628"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51109825878_71fb66ff80_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="IMG_20210411_120628"></a>
<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>The walking and cycling provision on the LCID side of the river is good, with steps that are wide and a ramp for cycling, wheelchairs and pushchairs.
The ramp onto the bridge from the East side of the river has a shallow incline, although is unnecessarily maze-like (possibly this is to reduce cycling speeds to the benefit of other users which seems sensible given the wide range of people using the path).</p>

<div id="the-waterside-cycle-path-in-east-leeds" class="section level2">
<h2>The waterside cycle path in East Leeds</h2>
<p>From the LCID we proceeded southeast along waterside cycleway that follows the River Aire all the way out to <a href="https://actdev.cyipt.bike/allerton-bywater/">Allerton Bywater, which is another new housing development that is part of the ActDev project</a>.
The route has recently been resurfaced, as described in an <a href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/our-blog/news/2020/may/upgraded-leeds-waterside-cycle-path-now-open-for-locals">article by Sustrans</a>.
Having used this cycleway for more almost a decade it is hard to put into words how much better it is after the upgrade, but I will try.
It is waaaaaaaaaaaay better.</p>
<p>Before the upgrade the path was thin, bumpy and often muddy
Now it is wide, smooth and attractive.
The difference can be seen in the before/after photos below (credit: Sustrans).</p>

<p>The surface is as smooth as tarmac on a road (smoother than most roads in Leeds, which have many potholes due to constant erosion by motor traffic) but has a rustic feel.</p>
<p>One issue with the route (that is already well <a href="https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/transport/alistair-brownlee-backs-campaign-new-crossing-skelton-grange-road-bridge-trans-pennine-trail-3134542">documented</a> and is the subject of a <a href="http://www.leedscyclingcampaign.co.uk/skelton-grange-bridge">campaign by Leeds Cycling Campaign</a>) is that you are forced onto steps to go from Skelton Grange Road bridge onto a cycleway located between the River Aire on the East and the Aire and Calder Navigation canal to West, as shown below.</p>

<p>Aside from the steps, this section is also great to ride on and is part of the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/10508149">Trans Pennine Trail from Leeds to Sheffield</a> 40 miles to the South.</p>
