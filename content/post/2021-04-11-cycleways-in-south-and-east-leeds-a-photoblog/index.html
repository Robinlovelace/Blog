<p>Taking advantage of a sunny Sunday me and a friend decided to check-out the latest active travel infrastructure developments in South and East Leeds.
We planned the route around two destinations and one well-established route:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://citu.co.uk/citu-places">Leeds Climate Innovation District</a>, a new sustainability-focussed housing development with 500+ new dwellings being built near central Leeds</li>
<li>test</li>
</ul>
<p>the well-known <a href="https://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Wyke%20Beck%20Way%20Cycle%20Route.pdf">Wyke Beck Way</a>.</p>
