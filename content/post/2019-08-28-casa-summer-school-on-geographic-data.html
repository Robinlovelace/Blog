<p>Last week I presented at UCL’s summer school which, by all accounts, was a very successful event in which many people learned many new skills.
The presentation format was a refreshing changes from the PowerPoint slides you’re often asked to prepare.
Instead, each presenter was asked to create a reproducible RMarkdown document to present.
The source code was shared with the students, who were encouraged to test the code.</p>
<p>The source code of my RMarkdown document can be found here, on the website support the Geocomputation with R book: <a href="https://github.com/geocompr/geocompr.github.io/blob/source/content/post/2019/crs-projections-transformations.Rmd" class="uri">https://github.com/geocompr/geocompr.github.io/blob/source/content/post/2019/crs-projections-transformations.Rmd</a></p>
<p>To see the article itself, head here: <a href="https://geocompr.github.io/post/2019/crs-projections-transformations/" class="uri">https://geocompr.github.io/post/2019/crs-projections-transformations/</a></p>
