2020 has been a crazy year all-round with US elections, Brexit negotiations reaching their conclusions and of course the global pandemic that has swept across countries and disrupted lives worldwide.

Looking back over the year a huge amount has changed and I wanted to take the opportunity of the new year to share some thoughts and update, providing an opportunity to post on my updated website âœ¨.

## Online teaching

I was lucky enough to work from home meaning that I could plough on with my research and teaching in ITS.
In fact, my first fully online-only taught lecture, part of the Transport Data Science module, was delivered on the 17^th^ March, as communicated in the Tweet below. 

```{r}

```

That was on 17th March, just one day after the Prime Minister advised against "non-essential" travel and in-person social interaction on [March 16th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_Kingdom_(January%E2%80%93June_2020)#March_2020).
It was not until three days later that cafes, pubs and restaurants were closed.
