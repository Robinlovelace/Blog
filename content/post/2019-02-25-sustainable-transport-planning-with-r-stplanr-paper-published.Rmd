I am very happy to announce that the paper *stplanr: A package for transport planning* has been published in The R Journal.
This is the result of around 3 years of work:
it took us (co-author [Richard Ellison](https://business.sydney.edu.au/staff/richard.ellison) and me) over a year to get round to writing the paper after the **stplanr** package was first released on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stplanr) in November 2015 (see its [archive on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/stplanr/) for details); it wasn't until March 2017 that the paper was formally submitted.
Since then, the paper has been in the review process for almost 2 years, before finally being published last week (although confusingly, as )
