## Making websites with Hugo and R

For people interested in how I set this site, see the changes tracked on GitHub to transition to the new site here: https://github.com/rbind/robinlovelace/pull/5

Useful things I found along the way:

```bash
pip3 install -U academic
academic import --bibtex assets/bibs/my-publications.bib
```
