<p>Having recently acquired a new laptop, an <a href="https://www.entroware.com/store/laptops/proteus">Entroware Proteus</a> (shown below), I had to remind myself how to set-it-up for my needs.
This includes the usual things like document editing, web browsing and email.
But as much of my work involves developing and using R for geographic research it had to have R installed.</p>

<p>I documented the process of upgrading Ubuntu, adding the appropriate software repositories and installing packages in a recent blogpost on the website <a href="https://geocompr.github.io/">geocompr.github.io</a>, the website supporting our open source book <a href="https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/">Geocomputation with R</a>.</p>
<p>If you use Ubuntu, or are thinking of switching to Ubuntu (a sensible choice for someone looking for a user-friendly and stable mostly open source operating system), check-out the details here: <a href="https://geocompr.github.io/post/2020/installing-r-spatial-ubuntu/" class="uri">https://geocompr.github.io/post/2020/installing-r-spatial-ubuntu/</a></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
