<p>I am very happy to announce that the paper <em>stplanr: A package for transport planning</em> has been published in The R Journal <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lovelace_stplanr_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Lovelace and Ellison 2018</a>)</span> üéâ.</p>
<p>This is the result of around 3 years of work:
it took us (co-author <a href="https://business.sydney.edu.au/staff/richard.ellison">Richard Ellison</a> and me) over a year to get round to writing the paper after the <strong>stplanr</strong> package was first released on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=stplanr">CRAN</a> in November 2015 (see its <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/stplanr/">archive on CRAN</a> for details); it wasn‚Äôt until March 2017 that the paper was formally submitted.</p>
<p>After that, it was in the review process for almost 2 years, before finally being published last week.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Confusingly, the paper has an official publication date of 2018, despite the second volume of The R Journal in 2018 actually being finished in 2019!
See the <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018-1/">current issue</a> of The R Journal for all papers in this second 2018 volume.
There are some interesting papers in there, not least an explanation of methods for visualising point density by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-evangelista_geospatial_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Evangelista and Beskow</a> (<a href="#ref-evangelista_geospatial_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, and an explanation of <em>another</em> pipe <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mount_dot-pipe_2018" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>mount_dot-pipe_2018?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Instead of going into the details of what the paper says (see the nicely formatted <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-053/RJ-2018-053.pdf">pdf</a> for that), I‚Äôd like to finish this post by saying a big THANK YOU to the editorial team behind The R Journal for such a high standard (better than many expensive journals I might add, The R Journal is volunteer-run to the best of my knowledge), especially Roger Bivand and John Verzani.</p>
<p>Plans are afoot to build on the moment behind <strong>stplanr</strong>, which originated as a place to store code that I was using to develop the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT, hosted at <a href="http://www.pct.bike/">www.pct.bike</a>) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lovelace_propensity_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Lovelace et al. 2017</a>)</span> and make additional, overdue improvements to the package.
For more on that, please head-over to the issue tracker (input welcome) or take a read of the <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-053/RJ-2018-053.pdf#page=14">final section</a> of the just-publised paper.</p>

I should say, that it was not the fault of The R Journal‚Äôs editorial team that it took so long to publish the paper:
I asked for it to be put on hold while I completed the mammoth task of re-writing dozens of functions to support sf (see the pull request in which the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/pull/198"><code>sfr</code></a> branch was merged into <code>master</code> for the grizzly details).<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
