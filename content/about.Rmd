## Welcome

Welcome to my website. My aim for it is to provide a place for me to get my work and ideas out-there quickly and link together my outputs across the internet into a single place. Enjoy your visit!

## About me

I'm a geographer and environmental scientist specialising in [spatial data analysis](https://www.crcpress.com/Spatial-Microsimulation-with-R/Lovelace-Dumont/p/book/9781498711548) and [R programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/). Based at the Institute for Transport Studies ([ITS](https://www.its.leeds.ac.uk/people/r.lovelace)) I have a growing interest in transport modelling, as illustrated by a [book review](http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/102373/1/urban-travel-rl.pdf) of a [book](http://www.e-elgar.com/shop/forecasting-urban-travel) on the subject @boyce_forecasting_2015.

I studied Geography at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/) after moving out of my home town of Hereford where I went to [Weobley High School](http://weobleyhigh.co.uk/) out in rural northwest Herefordshire and the Hereford [Sixth Form College](http://www.hereford.ac.uk/). 

From an early age I enjoyed travelling. Between moving to Bristol when I left home to settling in Leeds for my current job I moved 3 times:

- To Salamanca in 2006 for a year studying at the [Universidad de Salamanca](http://www.usal.es/) on the Erasmus scheme, where I learned Spanish.

- To York in 2008, where I was awarded a scholarship to do a master's degree in [Environmental Science and Management](https://www.york.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/courses/msc-environmental-science-management/) at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/).

- To Sheffield in 2009, where I was awarded a PhD scholarship to research Energy Futures at the [University of Sheffield](http://shef.ac.uk/) as part of the [E-Futures](http://e-futures.group.shef.ac.uk/page/home/) Doctoral Training Centre.

I moved ([by bicycle trailer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a8QLiC4LV8)) from Sheffield to Leeds in summer 2013 for to take a post-doctorate fellowship in Geospatial Data Analysis and Simulation ([TALISMAN](http://www.researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk/grants/RES-576-25-0039/read)). A year later I got a job at the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics ([LIDA](http://lida.leeds.ac.uk/)) where I am still based alongside my role in ITS.

I have been based at the Leeds Institute for Transport Studies ([ITS](https://www.its.leeds.ac.uk)) since September 2016 as a University Academic Fellow in Transport and Big Data.  Here work on researching the energy impacts of transport systems, modelling sustainable transport uptake and visualizing transport futures.

## Applied work

I've applied my skills to a number of projects with real-world applications, most recently the Propensity to Cycle Tool [@lovelace_propensity_2017], a nationally scalable interactive online mapping application for the Department for Transport. 

I also develop the [stplanr](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr) package for sustainable transport planning.

## About this website

This website was built using open source software. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static website generator written in Go, provides the static pages. [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), an R package by Yihui Xie, provides support for quick blog post creation using RMarkdown.
