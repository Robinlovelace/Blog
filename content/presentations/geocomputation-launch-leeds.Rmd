### Lecture and book launch, part of [Leeds Digital Festival](https://leedsdigitalfestival.org/)


This talk will introduce [*Geocomputation with R*](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/), a new book on R for geographic data that has just been published.
Aimed at people new to the subject, I'll provide some examples to show the power of programming with open source software for high-performance, reproducible mapping and geographic analyis.
I will cover a bit of the history but focus on visualisation, which is key to using data to understand the world.
Finally, I will provide some pointers for people wanting to get *stuck in* and use geocomputation to better understand the world, influence policy and have fun with maps
