## Keynote talk at [SatRdays Newcastle](https://newcastle2019.satrdays.org/#portfolio)

### Geocomputation with R: Reproducible Geo* workflows, from getting data to making maps


This talk will introduce [*Geocomputation with R*](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/), a new book on R for geographic data.
It will demonstrate how far R has evolved as an environment for geographic data analysis and visualisation, and provide a taster of what is in the book and, more importantly, what is possible when 'data science' and 'GIS' meet.
With new packages such as **sf**, geographic data analysis has become more accessible.
The talk will show how geographic analysis can bring local examples to life.

### R packages:


  * [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf)
  * [stplanr](https://ropensci.github.io/stplanr/)
