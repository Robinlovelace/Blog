<p>This was the finale of a week of research collaboration and teaching at the Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena <a href="https://www.geographie.uni-jena.de/">Institut für Geographie</a>.
During the study visit I also worked on <em>Geocomputation with R</em> with fellow co-author <a href="https://www.geographie.uni-jena.de/en/Chairs/GIScience/Team/M%C3%BCnchow.html">Jannes Muenchow</a> and wrote a tutorial on route network analysis in R that can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocomp-tranport-workshop" class="uri">https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocomp-tranport-workshop</a></p>
