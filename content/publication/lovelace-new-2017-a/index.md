abstract: This paper explores the potential for emerging methods Machine Learning
  and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to be applied to transport modelling at the origin-destination
  (OD) level. OD data is inherently spatial and is complex, due to the multitude of
  ways of allocating geographic attributes to the OD pairs (e.g. buffers and intersections
  with geographic representations of OD data generated using straight desire lines,
  shortest path algorithms or probabilistic routing). This makes their analysis an
  interesting geocomputational challenge, seldom tackled by geographers. The application
  of Machine Learning and DAG methods, developed in other fields, to this geographical
  data holds great potential to improve the ability to infer causality in mode split
  from OD data. However, there are also pitfalls to using these methods which can
  be black boxes, even if the code is open source, if the analyst does not understand
  what they are doing with the data. Based on the work we discuss ways to ensure new
  methods in the field are used wisely and set-out next steps for our own research.
