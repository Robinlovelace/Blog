abstract: 'Background It is important to model the determinants of mode choice for
  many health-related reasons: to find-out what is holding people back from healthy
  active travel choices, to understand the drivers of detrimental car dependency,
  and to identify the causal factors over which public authorities have some control.
  Another motivation is that model results could feed into forecasts of behaviour
  change following specific interventions. Numerous papers have explored the issue
  but few have been able to provide results that can feed-into models forecasting
  uptake following local interventions for a number of reasons including small sample
  size, lack of a temporal component, and use of explanatory variables that cannot
  easily be applied beyond the case study region. This gap in the literature was identified
  and tackled as part of a UK Department for Transport funded project to develop a
  Cycling Infrastructure Prioritisation Toolkit (CyIPT). Methods Origin-destination
  (OD) data on commuter mode choice was obtained from the 2001 and 2011 Census. The
  data was processed to ensure that the 2001 data, which was provided at a different
  geographic level, as compatible with the 2011 data. It was further processed to
  create a dependent variable (cycling uptake) and explanatory variables including
  environmental (e.g. length of off-road cycle infrastructure) and demographic (e.g.
  age and gender splits) factors, for each desire-line. A model was developed to explain
  cycling uptake as a function of the explanatory variables and forecast future uptake
  following simulated interventions. Results Preliminary results show a clear infrastructure
  signal in the noise surrounding mode choice but other factors seem to be at play.
  Further research over the coming months will seek to improve the model and our resulting
  ability to forecast uptake at the local level from specific interventions. Conclusions
  Newly available data, combined with emerging high performance and open source statistical
  software, mean that large natural experiments on the impact of new infrastructure
  on mode choice can now be performed at the national level using geographically detailed
  data at the origin-destination level. This has the potential to make the prioritisation
  of new infrastructure much more evidence-based and holds the promise of allowing
  a-priori benefit-cost estimates to be automated to support transport planners to
  enable a rapid transition away from fossil fuels and towards healthy travel patterns
  across the world, in urban and rural areas alike.'
