abstract: "This tutorial is an introduction to spatial data in R and map making with\
  \ R's `base' graphics and the popular graphics package ggplot2. It assumes no prior\
  \ knowledge of spatial data analysis but prior understanding of the R command line\
  \ would be beneficial. For people new to R, we recommend working through an `Introduction\
  \ to R' type tutorial, such as \\\"A (very) short introduction to R\\\" (Torfs and\
  \ Brauer, 2012) or the more geographically inclined \\\"Short introduction to R\\\
  \" (Harris, 2012). Building on such background material, the following set of exercises\
  \ is concerned with specific functions for spatial data and visualisation. It is\
  \ divided into five parts: *Introduction, which provides a guide to R's syntax and\
  \ preparing for the tutorial *Spatial data in R, which describes basic spatial functions\
  \ in R *Manipulating spatial data, which includes changing projection, clipping\
  \ and spatial joins *Map making with ggplot2, a recent graphics package for producing\
  \ beautiful maps quickly *Taking spatial analysis in R further, a compilation of\
  \ resources for furthering your skills An up-to-date version of this tutorial is\
  \ maintained at https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R and the entire\
  \ tutorial, including the input data can be downloaded as a zip file, as described\
  \ below. The entire tutorialwas written in RMarkdown, which allows R code to run\
  \ as the document compiles. Thus all the examples are entirely reproducible. Suggested\
  \ improvements welcome - please fork, improve and push this document to its original\
  \ home to ensure its longevity. The tutorial was developed for a series of Short\
  \ Courses put on by the National Centre for Research Methods, via the TALISMAN node\
  \ (see geotalisman.org)."
